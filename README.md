# pneumonia: Learning NN by creating a FFMLP

To gain a deeper understanding how a neural network functions (particularly backpropagation) I am creating a feedforward multilayer perceptron which will hopefully classify bacterial and viral pneumonia from Kermany et al. (2018) "Identifying Medical Diagnoses and Treatable Diseases by Image-Based Deep Learning".

The dataset is accessible here:
